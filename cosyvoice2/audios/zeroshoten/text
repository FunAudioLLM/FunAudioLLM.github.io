1	Incorporating physics principles into Artificial Intelligence could also have a major impact on many experimental applications, such as designing AI methods that are more easily verifiable.
2	DNA is the fundamental molecule for life on Earth, but it might soon become a key component in the construction of nanoelectronic devices as well.
3	However, surface effects become dominant as the materials in nanostructured devices become thinner, which means that surface waves may provide the thermal transport solution required.
4	Scientists have developed an allseason smartroof coating that keeps homes warm during the winter and cool during the summer without consuming natural gas or electricity.
